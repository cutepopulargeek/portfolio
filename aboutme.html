<h2> Broad Information </h2>

<body> I am not going to have this accessible to users because it is personal information.
  I found other people use images to fill in blank spaces and it looked cool. I am most 
  proud that i learned to code with programs </body>

<h1>Core4</h1>
<p> 1) Variable- Is used to store specific vales in a program. Ex: 
 if (x > y):
   print("x is greater than y")
   x = x -1
else:
   print("x is less than or equal to y"). If this happens than this happens but if that doesnt happen then this other thing happens.
</p>
<p>
  2) Loops- Is a series of loops that make something repeat itself continuously.
Ex:  for letter in 'Python':     # First Example
   print 'Current Letter :', letter

fruits = ['banana', 'apple',  'mango']
for fruit in fruits:        # Second Example
   print 'Current fruit :', fruit
print "Good bye!"
 The value of already defined variables can be updated. This will be particularly important in loops. 
To prepare for that we first follow how variables can be updated in an even simpler, sequential situation.
Sequence types are used in for loops. We will look at a basic sequence type: list.

  3)Conditionals- Imposing, containing, subject to, or depending on a condition or conditions; 
  not absolute; made or allowed on certain terms: conditional acceptance
 EX: food = 'spam'
if food == 'spam':
    print('Ummmm, my favorite!')
    print('I feel like saying it 100 times...')
    print(100 * (food + '! '))
</p>
<p>
  4) Functions- Is the route that the program goes.
  Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ). 
</p>


<p> A list is useful to create diffent codes to connect it to different programs.
  The group that worked with me was Lisa, Emily and Sanidah
