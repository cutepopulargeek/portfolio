<body> Hay guys, I need help. I am working on a code for making a class in the social network objective that was in class today.
I was wondering how do you finish this part of the code? 
 <br > def findUser(self, nameToSearch): <br />
        <br >for i in self.users: <br />
Please respond as soon as possible. Thanks. </body>

<body> Hello Rose Ana. To finish the code it would look like this:
<br > def findUser(self, nameToSearch): <br />
        <br >for i in self.users: <br />
           <br >if i.name == nameToSearch:<br />
               <br >return i<br /> 
            <br >return None <br />
This will make the code run. </body>
