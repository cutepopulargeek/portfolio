<body> Hello Rose Ana. To finish the code it would look like this:<br > 
 def findUser(self, nameToSearch): <br />
        <br >for i in self.users: <br />
           <br >if i.name == nameToSearch:<br />
               <br >return i<br /> 
            <br >return None <br />
This will make the code run. </body>

<body> Hay guys, I need help. I am working on a code for making a class in the mini menu objective that was in class today.
I was wondering if this code is correct? <br > 
 class Dog:<br />
     <br >def __init__(self,name):<br />
         <br >self.name = name<br />
         <br >self.organs = ["Heart","Kidneys","Liver","Lungs"]<br />
         <br >self.legs = 4<br />
         <br >self.ears = 2<br />

 <br >Fred = Dog ("Freddy")<br />
 <br >Ted = Dog ("Teddy")<br />
 <br >print (Fred.name)<br />
 <br >print (Fred.organs)<br />
 <br >print (Fred.legs)<br />
 <br >print (Fred.ears)<br />
 <br >print (Ted.name)<br />
 <br >print (Ted.organs)<br />
 <br >print (Ted.legs)<br />
 <br >print (Ted.ears)<br />
Please respond as soon as possible. Thanks. </body>
