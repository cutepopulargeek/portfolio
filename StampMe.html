<body> Hello Rose Ana. To finish the code it would look like this:<br > 
 def findUser(self, nameToSearch): <br />
        <br >for i in self.users: <br />
           <br >if i.name == nameToSearch:<br />
               <br >return i<br /> 
            <br >return None <br />
This will make the code run. </body>
